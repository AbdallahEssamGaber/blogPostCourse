# blogPostCourse
while learning more about back-end I was playing along with paths and requests 


- Main route page showing all the posts and if its too long theres a hyperlink to go to the spesfic page of the post.
- all the posts can accessed with `/posts/nameOfThePost`
- you can compose a post or a blog by going to `/compose`
